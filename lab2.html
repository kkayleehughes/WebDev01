<h3>The minimalism art style made way in the 60s and 70s. This started to 
    take over the abstract movement that had just taken over the years prior. </h3>
<h5> Carl Andre, Dan Flavin, Donald Judd, Sol LeWitt, Agnes Martin and Robert Morris were artists who inspired this movement. The minimalism movement 
    is known as the highest form of pure beauty, the simplicity and cleaness of the art style bring clamness which draws people in.</h5>
